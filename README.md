Blockchain Implementation (Go + React) + MetaMask Sepolia Test Transaction
This repository contains two main parts of my assignment:
A simple blockchain implemented in Go with Proof-of-Work and a React frontend
A MetaMask Sepolia test transaction demonstrating wallet usage, testnet ETH transfer, and Etherscan verification
Part 1 — Blockchain Implementation (Go + React)
I developed a basic blockchain using Go for the backend and React for the frontend interface.
The blockchain supports:
Adding transactions
Mining new blocks using Proof-of-Work
Viewing all blocks
Searching transactions by keyword
Automatic React UI refresh after actions
🔹 Features
Genesis block includes: Sumera Malik — Roll No: 21i-1579
REST API endpoints:
/view – View full blockchain
/tx – Add a transaction
/mine – Mine a new block
/search – Search for a keyword
React UI allows:
Adding transactions
Mining blocks
Searching blockchain data
Viewing block hashes, previous hashes, nonce, and data
React dashboard showing blockchain blocks (Page 2–4)
Mining and transaction forms
Search interface
Blockchain output 
Part 2 — MetaMask + Sepolia Test Transaction
For this part, I performed a real test transaction on the Sepolia Ethereum Testnet.
🔹 Steps Completed
Installed MetaMask and set up Account 1
Enabled Sepolia Test Network
Claimed test ETH from a Sepolia PoW faucet
Created Account 2
Sent 0.01579 SepoliaETH from Account 1 → Account 2
Verified transaction as Confirmed on Sepolia Etherscan
Verified that Account 2 received the exact amount
Faucet reward page
MetaMask transaction page
Send page showing 0.01579 SepoliaETH
Confirmed transaction in Activity tab
Account 2 balance increase
All of this is visible in pages 6–9 of the uploaded report. 


Conclusion
Both parts of the assignment were successfully completed:
The Go + React blockchain works fully with mining, transactions, viewing, and searching
The Sepolia transaction succeeded and was verified on Etherscan
Screenshots demonstrate the entire process
